# Smear Slide Preparation

Preparation of sediment smear slides for transmitted-light and polarised-light microscopy. A small amount of sediment is spread on a glass slide, dried on a hot plate, and permanently mounted with a UV-cured adhesive. The method is suitable for lake-sediment cores and sediment-trap material.

## Safety

::: callout-warning
## UV radiation and adhesive

-   **UV lamp** — do not look directly into the UV light source. Curing takes place inside a shielded UV box.
-   **Drei Bond adhesive** (6020 / 6023) — avoid skin contact. Wear nitrile gloves. Wash hands thoroughly after work. Refer to the relevant Safety Data Sheets (SDS) stored in the laboratory.
:::

## Consumables and equipment

### Chemical reagents

-   Deionised water (or redistilled water, MilliQ).
-   Ethanol (technical grade) — for slide cleaning and, optionally, as a dispersing medium.

### Equipment

-   Hot plate (capable of **60–70 °C**).
-   UV curing box (enclosed UV lamp).

### Other materials

-   Glass microscope slides (plain, 76 × 26 mm).
-   Cover slips.
-   UV-cured adhesive: **Drei Bond 6020** (higher viscosity) and **Drei Bond 6023** (lower viscosity).
-   Stainless-steel spatula.
-   Tweezers (fine-tip).
-   Pasteur pipette or disposable dropper.
-   Pre-printed slide labels or a diamond-tip pen.
-   Cardboard slide cases or slide storage boxes.

## Preparation

### Sampling plan

-   Define regular sampling intervals along the core, typically every **8–10 cm**, depending on core length and research objectives.
-   Plan additional samples at characteristic horizons (e.g., light and dark laminae, visible tephra layers, colour changes).

### Workspace preparation

-   Clean glass slides with deionised water or ethanol and wipe dry with a lint-free cloth.

-   Label each slide according to the labelling scheme below.

## Combined laminae on one slide

If a light and a dark lamina are placed on the same slide, record additional notes in the laboratory documentation (e.g., tephra, colour, prior HCl treatment).
:::

## Procedure

### Slide preparation

1.  Using a spatula, place a small amount of sediment on the glass slide.

::: callout-important
## Even distribution

Spread the material as evenly and thinly as possible. Overly thick areas will be opaque under the microscope and cannot be analysed.
:::

2.  Add one drop of deionised water (or ethanol) with a Pasteur pipette. Spread the sediment evenly using the spatula or a wooden toothpick.

3.  Place the slide on the hot plate set to **60–70 °C**. Leave until the water has evaporated completely and the sediment is fully dry — approximately **2–5 min**.

4.  Remove the slide from the hot plate. Apply one drop of **Drei Bond** adhesive onto the dried sediment. Using tweezers, gently lower a cover slip onto the adhesive.

::: callout-tip
## Adhesive choice

Use **Drei Bond 6020** (thicker) for coarser or mineral-rich sediment, and **Drei Bond 6023** (thinner) for fine-grained, organic sediment. The thinner adhesive flows more easily under the cover slip.
:::

5.  Place the slide in a cardboard slide case (or on a cardboard support) and expose to **UV radiation** for approximately **1–2 min** inside the UV curing box.

6.  After curing, verify that the cover slip is firmly bonded. Press gently at the edges — the slip should not move.

### Storage

-   Store finished slides in dedicated slide storage boxes, sorted by core and depth.
