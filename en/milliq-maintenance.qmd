# MilliQ Water Purification System: Maintenance

Routine maintenance of the Milli-Q water purification system, including scheduled filter replacements, UV lamp replacement, and weekly upkeep procedures. Following these intervals ensures a continuous supply of ultrapure water for laboratory use.

## Consumables and equipment

### Replacement parts

-   Under-sink pre-filter cartridge (`JAPLPK001`) — replacement every 12 months or when clogged.
-   Air vent filter (rear of the unit) — replacement every 12–24 months. Spare stored in the drawer.
-   SmartPak purification cartridge (`SPR00SIA1`) — replacement every 12 months or after any period with the unit switched off.
-   UV lamp — replacement every 24 months.

### Tools and materials

-   Blue plastic wrench (large ring) — for under-sink filter only.
-   Sanitisation kit — stored in the drawer; required if algae appear in the reservoir.

## Procedure

### Filter 1: Under-sink pre-filter

Replace the under-sink pre-filter (`JAPLPK001`) once a year or when flow stops due to clogging.

1.  Close the water tap next to the filter.

2.  Open the bench-top tap (next to the unit's water supply connection) to release residual pressure.

3.  Unscrew the filter housing using the blue plastic wrench while holding the mounting bracket.

4.  Remove the old cartridge and insert the new one.

5.  Screw the housing back on **by hand** — do not use the wrench for tightening.

## O-ring seal
Check that the O-ring seal is seated correctly before tightening. A misaligned seal will cause leaks.

6.  Open the water tap and check for leaks.

### Filter 2: Air vent filter

Replace the air vent filter (rear panel) every 12–24 months.

-   Pull the old filter out — it is a press-fit connection.
-   Press the new filter into place.

### Filter 3: SmartPak cartridge

Replace the SmartPak cartridge (`SPR00SIA1`) every 12 months (the unit displays a reminder) or after any period during which the unit was switched off.

1.  Open the cartridge bay and slide the old SmartPak out along its rails.

2.  Slide the new SmartPak in until it clicks.

3.  Run a full first-pass filtration cycle and drain the water through the flexible hose into the sink.

4.  After the first-pass drain, dispense approximately **2 L** of ultrapure water and discard it.

## Post-replacement flush
The flush removes preservatives and loose particles from the new cartridge. Do not use water produced before the flush is complete.
:::

### UV lamp

Replace the UV lamp every 24 months. The unit displays a reminder when replacement is due. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for lamp access and installation.

### Routine weekly upkeep

Perform the following tasks once a week:

-   **Drain the reservoir.** Stagnant water promotes microbial growth. If algae are visible in the reservoir, install the sanitisation kit (stored in the drawer) and replace the SmartPak cartridge before restarting the unit.

-   **Wipe the unit** with a dry or lightly damp lint-free cloth to remove dust.

-   **Run the recirculation cycle.** Press `+` and `−` simultaneously to flush the internal loop and maintain water quality between uses.
