# Gamma Spectrometer: Operation and Reporting

Routine operating procedures for the high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma spectrometer, covering liquid nitrogen refilling of the detector dewar, sample changing, and spectrum reporting using *Genie 2000* software (Mirion Technologies / Canberra). The detector requires periodic liquid nitrogen refilling to maintain cryogenic cooling for HPGe crystal operation.

## Safety

::: callout-warning
## Cryogenic hazard — liquid nitrogen

-   **Liquid nitrogen (N~2~, −196 °C)** causes severe cryogenic burns on skin contact. Wear cryogenic gloves and safety goggles when handling the dewar and transfer equipment.
-   The dewar is heavy. Use proper lifting technique.
-   The dewar tap has **sharp metal edges** — handle with care during installation and removal.
-   Ensure adequate ventilation. Liquid nitrogen displaces oxygen in poorly ventilated spaces.
:::

## Consumables and equipment

### Equipment

-   HPGe gamma spectrometer with detector shield.
-   Dedicated PC with *Genie 2000* software (Mirion Technologies / Canberra).
-   Liquid nitrogen dewar with transfer tap, side valve, and securing cable.

### Other materials

-   Cryogenic gloves.
-   Safety goggles.
-   Sediment samples in sealed measurement containers.

## Procedure

### Liquid nitrogen refilling

The detector dewar must be refilled periodically. The procedure spans two days because the dewar requires several hours to build up sufficient transfer pressure after the tap is installed.

#### Day 1: pressurisation and partial transfer

1.  Install the tap on the dewar. Tighten the side valve and secure the tap with the steel cable.

2.  Wait several hours for the pressure inside the dewar to increase.

3.  Turn on the computer and open the detector in *Genie 2000*.

4.  The software will prompt: *"Measurement in progress, do you want to open anyway?"* — click `Yes`.

5.  The software will prompt: *"Do you want to stop the measurement?"* — click `No`.

6.  Stop the measurement manually: click `Stop` in the upper-left corner.

7.  Open the upper valve (black).

8.  Transfer a portion of the nitrogen into the detector dewar.

9.  Close the upper valve (black).

10. Wait **15–20 min** for the detector to restabilise, then resume the sample measurement.

## Detector stabilisation

After each nitrogen transfer the detector temperature is disturbed. Always wait **15–20 min** before resuming acquisition to allow the HPGe crystal to return to operating temperature.
:::

#### Day 2: full transfer and dewar storage

1.  Turn on the computer and open the detector in *Genie 2000*.

2.  Stop the measurement as described above (steps 4–6).

3.  Open the upper valve (black).

4.  Transfer nitrogen until liquid visibly leaks from the drain hose — this confirms the detector dewar is full.

5.  Close the upper valve (black).

6.  Wait **15–20 min**, then resume the sample measurement.

7.  After approximately **1 h**, once the dewar temperature has risen, remove the tap:

    -   Open the side valve to equalise pressure.
    -   Detach the tap carefully — the metal edges are sharp.

8.  Close the dewar and return it to the cold room.

9.  If nitrogen remains in the dewar, transfer the residue before the next delivery.

::: callout-important
## Record keeping

Record the nitrogen collection date and dewar mass in the tracking spreadsheet (`.xlsx`) on the department server. Note the transfer date in the laboratory calendar (Room 109).
:::

### Sample changing

1.  Turn on the computer and open the detector in *Genie 2000*.

2.  After the measurement is complete, save the spectrum: `File > Save as` — select the sample from the list.

3.  Clear the current spectrum: click `Clear`.

4.  Replace the sample in the detector.

5.  Start a new measurement: click `Start`.

6.  Save the new spectrum: `File > Save as`.

7.  Close *Genie 2000*.

8.  Back up all data using *DSynchronize*.

9.  Shut down the computer.

### Spectrum reporting

#### Calibration

1.  Open the spectrum file for the sample to be reported.

2.  Load the energy calibration: `Calibrate > Load`.

    -   Tick **Energy**, untick **Efficiency**.
    -   Select the file with the `*.energy` extension and double-click to load.

3.  Load the efficiency calibration: `Calibrate > Load`.

    -   Tick **Efficiency**.
    -   Select the file with the `*.efficiency` extension and double-click to load.

#### Analysis and report generation

4.  Run the analysis sequence: `Analyze > Execute Sequence > ECR_lab…`.

5.  Fill in the required fields in the dialogue window:

    -   **Sample name and ID** — use the format: three-letter lake code (no Polish diacritics), core collection year, core number, and sample number padded with leading zeros. Example: `JJJ_18-2_01`.
    -   **Sample mass** — enter the value using a decimal point (not comma).

    Confirm with `OK`.

::: callout-note
## Decimal separator

*Genie 2000* requires a **decimal point** (`.`) regardless of the operating system locale. Enter e.g. `12.34`, not `12,34`.
:::

6.  Isotope symbols should now appear on the spectrum. The report is saved automatically to disk.

7.  Close the spectrum file. **Do not save changes** to the spectrum.

8.  Repeat steps 1–7 for each remaining sample.

#### File management

9.  Navigate to `C:\GENIE2K\CAMFILES\REPFILES` and locate the generated report files.

10. Create a new folder for the sediment core and move the report files into it.

11. Back up all data using *DSynchronize* to synchronise the local drive with the department server.
