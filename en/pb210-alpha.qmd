# ²¹⁰Pb Sample Preparation for Alpha Spectrometry

Preparation of freeze-dried lake sediment samples for ²¹⁰Pb activity determination by alpha spectrometry. The procedure involves three-stage microwave acid digestion (HNO~3~, HClO~4~, HF) with a ²⁰⁹Po yield tracer, followed by evaporation and spontaneous deposition of polonium isotopes onto silver discs from a hot acidic solution containing ascorbic acid and hydroxylamine as reducing agents.

## Safety

::: callout-warning
## Corrosive and toxic reagents

This protocol uses the following concentrated acids — **all steps must be performed under a running fume hood**:

-   **HNO~3~ (65 %)** — strongly corrosive, releases toxic fumes.
-   **HClO~4~ (70 %)** — strong oxidiser, corrosive. Reacts violently with organic matter.
-   **HF (40 %)** — causes severe and potentially fatal burns; penetrates skin rapidly. Requires specialised PPE (double nitrile gloves, face shield).

Wear a laboratory coat, nitrile gloves, and safety goggles at all times. Refer to the relevant Safety Data Sheets (SDS) stored in the laboratory.

## Microwave digestion

CEM Teflon (PTFE) vessels are under elevated pressure during digestion. Open the vessels **only under the fume hood** and unscrew slowly to release pressure gradually.

## Consumables and equipment

### Chemical reagents

Digestion:

-   Nitric acid, HNO~3~ (65 %, concentrated).
-   Perchloric acid, HClO~4~ (70 %, concentrated).
-   Hydrofluoric acid, HF (40 %).
-   Hydrochloric acid, HCl (6 mol/L).
-   Hydrochloric acid, HCl (0.5 mol/L).

Yield tracer:

-   ²⁰⁹Po standard solution.

Deposition:

-   Ascorbic acid (C~6~H~8~O~6~).
-   Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH~2~OH · HCl).

Other:

-   Redistilled water (MilliQ).
-   Methanol or ethanol — for cleaning silver discs.

### Equipment

-   MARS-6 microwave digestion system (CEM) with Teflon (PTFE) vessels.
-   Teflon (PTFE) evaporation beakers with lids.
-   Heating plate (capable of **200 °C**).
-   Magnetic stirrer with heating function.
-   Deposition vessels with silver disc holders.
-   Magnetic stir bars (PTFE-coated).
-   Analytical balance (readability 0.1 mg).
-   Laboratory fume hood.

### Other materials

-   Plastic weighing vessels.
-   Silver discs, pre-cleaned.
-   Aluminium foil — for heating plate protection.
-   Adjustable pipette **100–1000 µL** with compatible tips.
-   Graduated pipettes or dispensers for acid volumes.
-   Laboratory marker for labelling silver discs.

## Preparation

### Sample preparation

-   Freeze-dry wet sediment samples (see [Freeze Drying](freeze-drying.qmd) protocol).

### Vessel preparation

-   Clean all plastic weighing vessels and Teflon (PTFE) digestion vessels. Rinse and dry thoroughly before use.

## Procedure

### Stage 1: Microwave acid digestion

#### Weighing and HNO~3~ digestion

1.  Place a clean plastic weighing vessel on the analytical balance and tare.

2.  Weigh approximately **0.2 g** of dry sediment into the vessel. Record the mass to **0.1 mg**.

3.  Transfer the sediment to a CEM Teflon (PTFE) digestion vessel.

4.  Add **3 mL** of concentrated HNO~3~ (65 %) to the digestion vessel, rinsing sediment from the walls.

5.  Using an adjustable pipette, add **200 µL** of ²⁰⁹Po standard solution to the digestion vessel.

## Yield tracer

The ²⁰⁹Po spike is essential for determining chemical recovery. Pipette carefully — the precision of the spike volume directly affects the accuracy of the final ²¹⁰Pb activity calculation.
:::

6.  Cap the Teflon vessels and screw tightly. Mix gently.

7.  Place the vessels in the MARS-6 microwave digestion system. Select `Classical Methods` and start programme `Pb-210 HNO3` (**100 °C**, **2 h**).

#### HClO~4~ digestion

8.  Remove the vessels from the microwave system. Open carefully under the fume hood — unscrew slowly.

9.  Add **3 mL** of concentrated HClO~4~ (70 %).

10. Cap the vessels, screw tightly, and mix gently. Return to the microwave system and start programme `Pb-210 HClO4` (**100 °C**, **2 h**).

#### HF digestion

11. Remove the vessels from the microwave system. Open carefully under the fume hood.

12. Add **3 mL** of HF (40 %).

::: callout-warning
## Hydrofluoric acid

HF causes deep, extremely painful burns that may not be immediately apparent. Wear double nitrile gloves and a face shield. Work strictly under the fume hood. In case of skin contact, rinse immediately and apply calcium gluconate gel.
:::

13. Cap the vessels, screw tightly, and mix gently. Return to the microwave system and start programme `Pb-210 HF` (**100 °C**, **4 h**).

### Stage 2: Evaporation and deposition

#### Transfer and evaporation

14. Remove the Teflon vessels from the microwave system.

15. Transfer the digested solution and any remaining sediment residue quantitatively to Teflon evaporation beakers using **5 mL** of HCl (6 mol/L) as a rinse. Ensure all material is transferred: mix the residue in the digestion vessel, pour into the evaporation beaker, rinse the vessel walls with HCl (6 mol/L), and add the rinse to the beaker.

16. Place the evaporation beakers on the heating plate set to **200 °C** (protect the plate surface with aluminium foil). Heat **without a lid** until distinct white fumes appear.

17. Cover the beakers with Teflon lids and continue heating for a minimum of **30 min** until the solution clarifies. Do not exceed **1 h** total heating time under the lid.

18. Remove the lids. Add **3 mL** of HCl (6 mol/L) and evaporate to dryness.

::: callout-important
## Do not ignite

Evaporate gently to a dry residue only. Do not allow the temperature to rise to the point of ignition — this would destroy the polonium isotopes.
:::

#### Dissolution and deposition

19. Dissolve the dry residue in **27 mL** of HCl (0.5 mol/L).

20. Add approximately **0.1 g** of ascorbic acid and **0.1 g** of hydroxylamine hydrochloride.

21. Heat the solution to **90 °C**. In the meantime, label silver discs with sample identifiers and the deposition date. Mount the silver discs in the holders with the clean polished side facing up.

22. Place PTFE-coated magnetic stir bars into the deposition vessels and close them. Position the vessels on the magnetic stirrer. Set heating to **10** (maximum) and rotation to **1** (minimum).

::: callout-note
## Deposition conditions

Adjust the stirring speed manually to the lowest stable rotation. Too-vigorous stirring reduces deposition efficiency. The solution temperature should remain at approximately **90 °C** throughout.
:::

23. Allow the deposition to proceed for a minimum of **4 h**.

24. Remove the silver discs from the deposition vessels. Rinse with redistilled water (MilliQ). Wipe with methanol or ethanol. Verify the labels and store securely until measurement.
