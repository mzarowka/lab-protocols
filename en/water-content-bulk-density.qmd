# Water Content and Wet Bulk Density of Sediments

Determination of water content (weight percent) and wet bulk density of unconsolidated sediments. Wet bulk density is obtained by measuring the mass of a known volume of wet sediment. Water content is determined gravimetrically by drying the same sample at **105 °C** until constant mass. After drying, the sediment is homogenised in a mortar and stored for subsequent analyses (loss on ignition, CNS, etc.).

## Consumables and equipment

### Equipment

-   Laboratory drying oven (capable of **105 °C**).
-   Analytical balance (readability **0.1 mg**).
-   Volumetric syringe (**5 mL**, cut tip) or equivalent volumetric sampler.

::: callout-note
## Syringe scale

Most disposable syringes are graduated in mL. If the syringe scale reads cm³, the volumes are identical (1 mL = 1 cm³).
:::

### Other materials

-   Porcelain evaporating dishes — one per sample.
-   Porcelain or agate mortar and pestle.
-   Stainless steel spatula.
-   Labelled sample containers with airtight lids.
-   Laboratory form or electronic datasheet.

## Preparation

-   Clean the porcelain evaporating dishes: wash with redistilled water (MilliQ), dry in the oven, and label each dish with a unique sample number using a porcelain marker or permanent label.

-   Weigh each empty evaporating dish. Record the mass ($m_d$) in the laboratory form.

## Procedure

### Wet bulk density

1.  Remove undecomposed organic remains (e.g., leaf fragments) and other coarse particles (e.g., mollusc shells) from the wet sediment surface.

2.  Set the syringe plunger to **5 mL**. Fill the syringe barrel with wet sediment using the spatula, pressing gently to avoid air pockets.

## Constant volume

Ensure that the syringe is filled exactly to the set volume mark. Air gaps or overfilling will bias the density calculation.

## Adjustable volume

The standard volume is **5 mL**. If the available sediment is limited, a smaller volume may be used — record the actual volume and apply it in the calculation.
:::

3.  Transfer the sediment from the syringe into the labelled evaporating dish.

4.  Weigh the evaporating dish with wet sediment. Record the mass ($m_d + m_w$) in the laboratory form.

### Drying and water content

5.  Programme the drying oven to **105 °C** (no time limit).

6.  Place all evaporating dishes in the oven and dry for at least **24 h**.

::: callout-tip
## Constant mass check

For high-precision work or very wet samples, weigh the dishes after **24 h**, return them to the oven for an additional **2 h**, and re-weigh. If the mass difference is less than **1 mg**, the sample has reached constant mass.
:::

7.  Remove the dishes from the oven and allow them to cool to room temperature.

::: callout-important
## Cooling

Allow samples to cool in a desiccator or on the bench away from draughts. Warm dishes attract moisture and yield artificially high masses.
:::

8.  Weigh each evaporating dish with dried sediment. Record the mass ($m_d + m_s$) in the laboratory form.

### Post-drying processing

9.  Transfer the dried sediment to a porcelain or agate mortar and grind thoroughly to a homogeneous powder.

10. Transfer the ground sediment to a labelled, airtight container, or proceed directly with further analytical protocols (e.g., [Loss on Ignition](loss-on-ignition.qmd), CNS analysis).

## Calculations

### Wet bulk density

$$
\rho_w = \frac{m_w}{V}
$$

where:

-   $\rho_w$ — wet bulk density (g/mL)
-   $m_w = (m_d + m_w) - m_d$ — mass of wet sediment (g)
-   $V$ — volume of wet sediment (mL)

::: callout-note
## Density units

The unit g/mL is numerically identical to g/cm³, which is conventional in sedimentology.
:::

### Water content

$$
W = \frac{m_w - m_s}{m_w} \times 100
$$

where:

-   $W$ — water content (%)
-   $m_w = (m_d + m_w) - m_d$ — mass of wet sediment (g)
-   $m_s = (m_d + m_s) - m_d$ — mass of dry sediment (g)

::: callout-note
## Dry bulk density

If dry bulk density is required, it can be derived from the same measurements:

$$
\rho_s = \frac{m_s}{V}
$$

where $\rho_s$ is the dry bulk density (g/mL) and $V$ is the original volume of wet sediment (mL).
