# Core Photography and Panorama Stitching

Photographic documentation of split sediment cores under controlled lighting conditions, followed by panorama stitching in *Hugin* to produce a continuous high-resolution composite image of each core section.

## Consumables and equipment

### Equipment

-   DSLR camera with manual exposure control and a compatible lens.
-   Sturdy tripod with horizontal arm (copy stand configuration).
-   Dedicated studio lighting (constant light sources mounted at the camera station).
-   Core holder with adjustable clamps.
-   Graduated scale bar (ruler) — one for narrow cores, one for wide cores.
-   Computer connected to the camera (tethered shooting).

### Software

-   *Hugin* — open-source panorama stitcher (installer: `Public\Software\Hugin`).

## Preparation

### Camera setup

-   Mount the camera on the tripod at the maximum height position.

::: callout-important
## Fixed camera position

Do not change the vertical position of the camera between photographs or between cores. Do not adjust the lens settings unless absolutely necessary — any change invalidates the panorama alignment.
:::

-   Set the camera to **full manual mode** with the following parameters:

    -   Shutter speed: **1/2 s**.
    -   Aperture: **f/11**.
    -   Autofocus (**AF**): **off**.

::: callout-note
## Scale bar selection

Use the **lower** scale bar for narrow cores (**Ø 63 mm**) and the **upper** scale bar for wide cores (**Ø 90 mm**).
:::

-   Switch on the studio lighting and verify the tethered connection to the computer.

### Core preparation

-   Retrieve cores from cold storage **one at a time**.
-   Unwrap the core section and carefully transfer it to the core holder.

## Procedure

### Photography

::: callout-important
## Controlled lighting

Take all photographs with the **room door closed** and **overhead lights off**. Only the dedicated studio lighting should be on. Ambient light variation between frames causes visible banding in the final panorama.
:::

-   Place the core section in the holder so that the end caps and sealing tape sit **outside** the clamps. Gently press the clamps to secure the core.

-   Align the scale bar and slide it to the top (stratigraphic top) of the core. The scale begins at **0.1 mm** — position accordingly.

-   Look through the viewfinder and centre the crosshair on **0.0** of the core. Adjust focus if necessary.

-   Take a photograph and advance the core by **5 cm**. Repeat until the entire section is covered.

::: callout-tip
## Overlap

The **5 cm** step ensures sufficient overlap between adjacent frames for reliable panorama stitching in *Hugin*.
:::

-   Wrap the core section and return it to cold storage immediately after shooting.

### Panorama stitching in Hugin

-   Open *Hugin* and switch to the expert interface: `Interface > Expert`.

-   In the `Photos` tab:

    -   Right-click → `Add individual images` — load all photographs for one core section.
    -   Run `Feature Matching > Align image stack` to detect and match control points automatically.

-   In the `Control Points` tab:

    -   Verify that no control points link non-adjacent photographs. Delete any erroneous matches.

-   Open `Fast Preview`:

    -   Run `Assistant > Align`.

-   Set the projection to `Cylindrical equirectangular (Mercator)`.

-   Use `Move/Drag > Straighten` to level the panorama.

-   Adjust the `Crop` area to remove black borders and retain only the core image.

-   Run `Assistant > Create panorama`. Save the project file first, then export the stitched panorama image.

## File naming

Name the exported panorama following the department convention: core identifier, section number, and date — for example, `LLL-1A-1_panorama_2025-06-15.tif`.
